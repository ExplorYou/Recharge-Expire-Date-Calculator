# Recharge Expire Date Calculator

## Project Title
Recharge Expire Date Calculator

## Description
A simple, user-friendly web application to calculate the expiration date of phone and WiFi recharges based on the recharge date and validity period. It also allows users to track recharge history, export/import history, and clear records. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and can be used directly from GitHub Pages without downloading.

## How to Use
### Accessing the Application
You can use the Recharge Expire Date Calculator directly from GitHub Pages:
1. Visit the deployed GitHub Pages link: `[Insert your GitHub Pages URL here, e.g., https://your-username.github.io/recharge-calculator/]`.
2. Alternatively, clone or fork the repository and open `recharge_calculator.html` in a web browser.

### Features
- **Phone Recharge Calculator**: Enter the name/number, recharge date, and validity period to calculate the expiration date.
- **WiFi Recharge Calculator**: Similar functionality for WiFi recharges.
- **History Tracking**: View, export, import, and clear recharge history for both phone and WiFi.
- **No Installation Required**: Runs directly in the browser via GitHub Pages.

### Instructions
1. **Calculate Expire Date**:
   - Enter the name or number (e.g., phone number or WiFi account ID).
   - Select the recharge date using the date picker.
   - Input the validity period in days.
   - Click "Calculate Expire Date" to see the result.
2. **View History**:
   - Click "Show Phone History" or "Show WiFi History" to display past recharge records.
3. **Export/Import History**:
   - Use "Export Phone History" or "Export WiFi History" to download records as a file.
   - Use "Import Phone History" or "Import WiFi History" to upload previously exported records.
4. **Clear History**:
   - Click "Clear Phone History" or "Clear WiFi History" to reset records.

## Setup for GitHub Pages
To host this project on GitHub Pages:
1. Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g., `recharge-calculator`).
2. Upload `recharge_calculator.html` to the repository.
3. Go to the repository's **Settings** > **Pages**.
4. Under **Source**, select the branch (e.g., `main`) and set the folder to `/ (root)`.
5. Save, and GitHub will provide a URL (e.g., `https://your-username.github.io/recharge-calculator/`).
6. Access the application via the provided URL.

## Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- No additional software or dependencies are required, as the application runs entirely in the browser.

## Notes
- The current HTML file requires JavaScript for functionality (e.g., date calculations, history management). Ensure you add the necessary JavaScript code to `recharge_calculator.html` before deploying.
- If you encounter issues, check the browser's console for errors or ensure all linked resources (e.g., CSS, JS) are correctly referenced.
- For local development, you can open `recharge_calculator.html` directly in a browser, but some features (e.g., import/export) may require a local server due to browser security restrictions.

## Contributing
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Make your changes and commit (`git commit -m 'Add feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Create a pull request.
